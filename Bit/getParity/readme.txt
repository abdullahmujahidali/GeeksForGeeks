 * Parity of a number refers to whether it contains an odd or even number of 1-bits. The number 
 * has “odd parity”, if it contains odd number of 1-bits and is “even parity” if it contains 
 * even number of 1-bits.

 Solution:
 ---------
 Can be done better than O(BitsOf(n))
 Where BitsOf(n) = number of bits in the integer n.
 if n = 24 = 11000
 BitsOf(n) = 5
