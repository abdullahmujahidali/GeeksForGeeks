 * Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such 
 * that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive 
 * numbers can be in any order.

 Solution 1:
 -----------
 Implemented using sorting.
 Time Complexity = O(nlogn)

 Solution 2:
 -----------
 Implemented using hashset.
