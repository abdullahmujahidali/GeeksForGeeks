 * Convert an array to reduced form
 * Given an array with n distinct elements, convert the given array 
 * to a form where all elements are in range from 0 to n-1. 
 * The order of elements is same, i.e., 0 is placed in place of smallest element, 
 * 1 is placed for second smallest element, â€¦ n-1 is placed for largest element.
 * Input:  arr[] = {10, 40, 20}
 * Output: arr[] = {0, 2, 1}
 * 
 * Input:  arr[] = {5, 10, 40, 30, 20}
 * Output: arr[] = {0, 1, 4, 3, 2}
