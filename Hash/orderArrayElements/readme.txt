 * Group multiple occurrence of array elements ordered by first occurrence.
 * Given an unsorted array with repetitions, the task is to group multiple occurrence of individual elements.
 * The grouping should happen in a way that the order of first occurrences of all elements is maintained.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {4, 6, 9, 2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 10, 4}
 * Output:        {4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9, 9, 2, 3, 10}
