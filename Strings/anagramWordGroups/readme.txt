 * Given an array of words, print all anagrams together. 
 * For example, if the given array is {“cat”, “dog”, “tac”, “god”, “act”}, 
 * then output may be “cat tac act dog god”.

 Solution:
 =========
 Simple Algo
 Time Complexity = O(mlogm * n) where m is the word size.
 (we can also implement it using the idea of Tries.)
 Space Complexity = O(n)
