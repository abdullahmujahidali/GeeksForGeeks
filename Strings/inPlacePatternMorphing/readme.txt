 * 
 * Given a string and a pattern, replace multiple occurrences of a pattern by character ‘X’. 
 * The conversion should be in-place and solution should replace multiple consecutive (and non-overlapping) 
 * occurrences of a pattern by a single ‘X’.
 * 
 * String – GeeksForGeeks
 * Pattern – Geeks
 * Output: XforX
 *  
 * String – GeeksGeeks
 * Pattern – Geeks
 * Output: X
 * 
 * String – aaaa
 * Pattern – aa
 * Output: X
