 * 
 * Given a string you need to print longest possible substring that has exactly M unique characters. 
 * If there are more than one substring of longest possible length, then print any one of them.
 * 
 * "aabbcc", k = 3
 * There are substrings with exactly 3 unique characters
 * {"aabbcc" , "abbcc" , "aabbc" , "abbc" }
 * Max is "aabbcc" with length 6.
