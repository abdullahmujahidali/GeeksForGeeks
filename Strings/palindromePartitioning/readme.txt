/**
 * http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-17-palindrome-partitioning/
 * 
 * Given a string, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning if 
 * every substring of the partition is a palindrome. 
 * For example, “aba|b|bbabb|a|b|aba” is a palindrome partitioning of “ababbbabbababa”. 
 * 
 * Determine the fewest cuts needed for palindrome partitioning of a given string. 
 * For example, minimum 3 cuts are needed for “ababbbabbababa”. 
 * The three cuts are “a|babbbab|b|ababa”.
