 * 
 * Given an array of integers, find length of the longest subarray which contains 
 * numbers that can be arranged in a continuous sequence.
 * 
 * Input:  arr[] = {10, 12, 12, 10, 10, 11, 10};
 * Output: Length of the longest contiguous subarray is 2 
 * 
 * Numbers in the array can be repeated.
