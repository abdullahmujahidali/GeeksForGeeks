Check for Majority Element in a sorted array
Question: Write a C function to find if a given integer x appears more than n/2 times in a sorted array of n integers.

Basically, we need to write a function say isMajority() that takes an array (arr[] ), arrayâ€™s size (n) and a number to be searched (x) as parameters and returns true if x is a majority element (present more than n/2 times).
