 * 
 * Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the difference between 
 * any two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number in arr[].
 * 
 * Examples: If array is [2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1] then returned value should be 8 (Diff between 10 and 2). 
 * If array is [ 7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2 ] then returned value should be 2 (Diff between 7 and 9)
