 * Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and associated profit 
 * if the job is finished before the deadline. It is also given that every job 
 * takes single unit of time, so the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. 
 * How to maximize total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.
