 * 
 * Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. 
 * The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order 
 * to perform the multiplications.

Solution:
---------
Implemented recursive algorithm.
DP solution is difficult to understand.
Try later.
